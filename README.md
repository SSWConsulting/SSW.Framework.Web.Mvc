SSW.Framework.Web.Mvc
=====================

<blockquote>“It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.” 
<br/>― Arthur Conan Doyle, The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</blockquote>

At SSW, we make lots of web applications using the ASP.NET technology stack. 
We love MVC and the new direction, tools and 3rd party libraries that are developing in this space.

As we work away building awesome solutions, we often create things that are useful beyond the scope of the current website. 
"Don't Repeat Yourself" is a principle we have taken to heart and so we have created this library to get all the little things in one place.

The first thing we do when creating an MVC web application is to install the SSW.Framework.Web.Mvc NuGet package.
SSW has now opened this framework up to the community to improve MVC applications everywhere.
